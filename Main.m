%% Sphero Multi-Agent Robotic Testbed - Matlab (SMART_Matlab)
%
% This script demonstrates how one can use SRP-Matlab to validate a
% distributed formation control strategy experimentally.
%
% In particular, the parameters are set to achieve a square grid formation
% with 9 Sphero robots, where 3 computers are used and each computer
% controls 3 robots. The number of robots, number of computers, and the
% desired formation can be changed to one's liking.
%
% Furthermore, the formation control algorithm that is called as a function
% in the main loop can be replaced by any other multi-agent strategy if
% desired.
%
% Questions and comments are welcome.

%% Preallocate parameters

%% Test Webcam
%
% Webcam must be connected to the computer, and Matlab webcam support package
% must be installed.

camList = webcamlist;  % Identify Available Webcams
if isfield(CameraParam,'cam')
    delete(CameraParam.cam)
    CameraParam = rmfield(CameraParam,'cam');
end

preview(cam);            % Preview Video Stream

clear cam                % Release webcam


%% Connect to Spheros

% Turn off all Sphero LEDs
pause(3);
for j = 1 : numRobLocal

end


%% Settings for recording the experiment movies

SpheroState.Video.VideoName = 'Test01';
SpheroState.Video.Record    = false;
SpheroState                 = SpheroVideoSetup_Ver1_0(SpheroState);


%% Initialize camera and detect checkerboard
%
% Camera must be looking at the arena floor and a checkerboard must be
% placed on the floor before running this section.
%
% If you don't have a checkerboard ready, you can print and use the one
% included in the "Images" folder. You need to make sure that "squareSize"
% is the correct size of each square on your printed checkerboard.
%
% For more detail on camera calibration see
% https://mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/single-camera-calibrator-app.html

CameraParam.paramFile  = 'CameraParams_Logitech_640x480_Gans.mat';

CameraParam = CameraCheckerboard_Ver1_2(CameraParam);


%% Theta0 estimation
%
% In this section we estimate the initil heading direction of each Sphero.
% The Sphero with LEDs turned on should be placed on the arena floor. Once
% a key is pressed the robot rolls forward and its initial heading is estimated.

SpheroState.Theta0 = SpheroTheta0_Ver1_5(SpheroState, CameraParam);


%% Setup TCPIP info
%
% This section is used when we have more than 1 computer. If you are using
% only 1 computer set:
%
% SpheroTCPIP.server  = 1;
% SpheroTCPIP.ip      = [];
%
% and comments the rest.
%
% When dealing with more than 1 computer, the computer use TCPIP initially
% to come to a consensus on the tag number of robots, and communicate the
% formation control gains. After this is done, there is no more need for
% communication and  experiment runs in a distributed manner.

SpheroTCPIP.server  = 0;                % 1 <--> server computer (or only one computer), 0 <--> client computer
% SpheroTCPIP.ip    = [];               % if only one computer is used
SpheroTCPIP.ip      = ["192.168.1.8"];  % of server or clients
SpheroTCPIP.gains   = [];               % update when calculated


%% Formation Control Gains
%
% In this section we find the formation control gains by solving an SDP
% problem using CVX.  CVX is a free software and is included in this
% folder.  You need to run "cvx_setup.m" before executing this section.

% If server, calculate formation control gains
